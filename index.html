            <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
            <p>I am a hardworking, passionate student from Northern Virginia. Currently, I am part of a specialized computer science program, 
                which is a field that interests me a lot due to its find array of applications in the workspace. Other forms of science, like physics 
                and biology, also greatly intrigue me, but I make sure to also give focus to other subject areas, such as History and English. My family and 
                friends are really important to me, and I spend a lot of time with them outside of school, whether it be playing board games, going out to eat, or 
                even helping each other with work. In the future, I would really love to work in the health sector in an area that uses priciples of computer science.
